edit bullseye.conf to point at the attached fao-countries.json and fao-countries_dukeConf.xml
as the graphsonPath and confPath.

then you can run the bullseye server with:
java -Dconfig.file=bullseye.conf -jar bullseye-webapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war 8080

alternatively, you can edit the application.conf in the root of the war file, and then
you don't need the separate bullseye.conf file or -D flag when running the war.
